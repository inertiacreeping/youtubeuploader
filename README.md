The (Automatic) Youtube Uploader (For Timelapses)

Welcome to the most automated, slightly magical way to upload your daily doses of breathtaking views to YouTube. 
(I use my (Timelapse Creator script)[https://github.com/inertiacreeping/Unifi-Timelapse] to create a daily timelapse of my local views, then this script monitors the output folder for new timelapse videos, and uploads them.)

## What It Does üöÄ

This Python script automatically scans and uploads any new videos in a specified folder to a specified YouTube channel every hour. 
Which videos will it upload? This script checks the filename of the video files it finds and only updates videos matching the last 7 days.

## Getting Started üõ†

Before you embark on this journey, there are a few things you need to set up:

### Google Cloud and YouTube API

This guide will walk you through creating a project in Google Cloud, enabling the YouTube Data API, and setting up OAuth 2.0 credentials for your Napier Timelapse Uploader.

#### Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. **Sign in to Google Cloud Platform**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and sign in with your Google account. Create an account if you don't have one, obviously.

2. **Create a New Project**
   - Click on the project dropdown near the top left of the page.
   - Click the "New Project" text in the top right of the new popup.
   - Enter a project name and select a billing account if prompted.
   - Click "Create".

#### Step 2: Enable the YouTube Data API v3

1. **Search for the YouTube Data API v3**
   - Use the top search bar to find "YouTube Data API v3".
2. **Enable the API**
   - Click on the YouTube Data API v3 and press "Enable".

#### Step 3: Create Credentials

1. **Access the Credentials Page**
   - Once the YouTube API has been enabled, click on the blue "Manage" button.
   - Once you're redirected to the API metrics page, click on "Create Credentials" blue button in the top right.

2. **Configure the OAuth Consent Screen**
   - Select the **user** data type 
   - Fill in the required fields (app name, user support email, developer contact information).
   - Save and continue, add scopes if necessary (I dunno, select all scopes).
   - Select "Desktop app" as the application type.
   - Name your OAuth client and click "Create".

4. **Download the JSON File**
   - Find the newly created credentials and click the download button to get your `YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE.json`.

## Step 4: Install Required Python Packages

Ensure you have the necessary Python packages:

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib


### Youtube API Services - Audit and Quota Extension Form

You'll need to fill out this (annoying form)[https://support.google.com/youtube/contact/yt_api_form?hl=en] for your channel, so that the videos aren't locked to private (to combat spam). Takes 2-5 days for Youtube to approve your app.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- `google-api-python-client` and `google-auth-oauthlib` packages installed. You can install them via pip:

```bash
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-oauthlib
```

- A Google Cloud project with the YouTube Data API v3 enabled (you should have done this previously)
- OAuth 2.0 credentials for a Desktop app downloaded as YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE.json.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the script directly.
2. Replace YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_FILE.json with the path to your downloaded OAuth 2.0 credentials file (or just put your secrets file in the same folder as the script)
3. Update the ROOT_VIDEO_DIRECTORY in the script to point to your timelapse videos directory (by default it's C:\Timelapse\snapshots)

### Usage
Simply run the script with Python and let the magic happen:

```bash
python youtube_upload.py
```

The script does its rounds every hour, checking for new timelapse videos and uploading them with the correct yesterday date in the title.

### Features ‚ú®
- Automatically uploads timelapse videos to YouTube.
- Titles the video based on the date of the day before, regardless of the filename.
- Adds a custom description for each video, sharing a snippet about the view and directing viewers to a new channel for future uploads.
- Maintains a log of uploaded videos to avoid duplicates.

### Customizing Your Uploads üé®
- Feel free to tweak the upload_video function to include your preferred tags, categories, or even modify the video description. This script is just a starting point to automate your uploads.

Yeah, not gonna lie, this was all ChatGPT (I can't code to save my life). But hey, it works.
